            <h2>What is a Cyclone?</h2>
            <p>A cyclone is a large-scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low pressure. Cyclones can cause widespread destruction, particularly through strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. They are categorized into tropical cyclones (formed over warm ocean waters) and extratropical cyclones (formed in cooler climates). Cyclones can bring dangerous winds, flooding, and power outages, and are often accompanied by tornadoes and heavy storms.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tropical Cyclones:</strong> These cyclones form in tropical and subtropical areas, with strong winds and heavy rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Extratropical Cyclones:</strong> These cyclones develop in higher latitudes and can cause severe weather like snowstorms and blizzards.</li>
                <li><strong>Tornadoes:</strong> Often associated with cyclones, these small-scale but very destructive storms are characterized by rotating columns of air.</li>

            <h2>What is a Drought?</h2>
            <p>A drought is an extended period of deficient rainfall relative to the statistical multi-year average for a region. This lack of water can result in water shortages, crop failures, and other consequences. Droughts can be triggered by a combination of factors, including weather patterns, changes in land use, and climate change. They can occur in both arid and semi-arid regions and can be long-lasting, sometimes lasting for months or even years, causing significant environmental and economic impacts.</p>

            <h3>Types of Droughts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meteorological Drought:</strong> Occurs when there is a prolonged period of below-average rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrological Drought:</strong> Happens when water resources such as rivers, reservoirs, or aquifers are depleted.</li>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Drought:</strong> Affects crop production due to a lack of moisture in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Socioeconomic Drought:</strong> Results in economic losses and a reduction in the quality of life due to insufficient water supply.</li>
